# Change detection of non-methane hydrocarbons in CARIBIC dataset
My Auckland University Theise

Most researches about the lower atmosphere (troposphere), concentrate on measuring its chem- ical components. Nowadays, researchers are more interested in discovering root causes which drive to changes in the amount of these components. They found this nearest layer to the earth gets impacted by seasonal changes as well as human influence.

In this thesis, we aim to detect chemical components changes in troposphere applying machine learning techniques on real-world data collected by IAGOS-CARIBIC observatory from 2005 to 2016 in Germany.

The experimental results have shown that the troposphere layer changed several times due to human faults and natural events such as volcano, earthquake, etc.

The model in this thesis is built using a three-stage machine learning strategy. Multi-target regression called ”Stochastic Gradient Descent” is applied as the first algorithm, ”Random Forests” (RF) as the imputation algorithm for missing values and prediction and M5P regres- sion to capture the main conclusion. ADWIN which supports RF and M5P is used as a change detection method to discover unusual changes of chemical components in the troposphere layer.

Based on 11 years data which we have processed, it has been discovered and proved as a final conclusion that there were unusual changes in chemical components of the troposphere, occurred at Jun 2010 due to some modifications introduced to oil and gas usage rule in the USA.
